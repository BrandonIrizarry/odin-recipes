	<h2>Description</h2>

	<p>Empanadas (sometimes known as <em>empanadillas</em>), at
	    their essence, consist of dough filled with something else
	    delicious, then deep fried to make a finger food.</p>
	<p>Empanadas are easy to make, and so are ideal
	    for:
	    <ul>
		<li>Picnics</li>
		<li>Any day trip where a lot of people need to be fed</li>
		<li>Selling</li>
	    </ul>
	</p>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
	    <li>Dough discs (1 pack)</li>
	    <li>Flour (1 small bag)</li>
	    <li>Corn oil (1 small bottle)</li>
	    <li>Cheese for frying (<em>queso frito</em>) (1 pack)</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Steps for pre-preparing a single empanada</h2>
	<ol>
	    <li>Dice cheese into portions an eighth of the size of the disc.</li>
	    <li>Add cheese onto disc.</li>
	    <li>Enclose cheese with disc. You may optionally use a
		fork to press down along the edge of the enclosure, though
		a good application with your fingers should suffice. </li>
	    <li>Powder the not-yet-fried empanada with some of the flour.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Steps for frying a set of five empanadas</h2>
	<ol>
	    <li>Pre-prepare five empanadillas, as described in the previous section.</li>
	    <li>Preheat some oil in a frying pan, enough to almost
	    submerge five. Wait until the oil sizzles.</li>
	    <li>Add the empanadas to the frying pan. After five minutes, flip each one over.</li>
	    <li>Repeat until they're a suitable golden-brown color.</li>
	</ol>
