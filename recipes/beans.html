	<h2>Description</h2>

	<p>
	    Rice and beans, when eaten together, complement each other
	    to form a complete protein. As a result, beans-and-rice
	    dishes are highly valued for protein in areas where animal
	    proteins are often hard to obtain and expensive. See <a href="https://www.heart.org/-/media/healthy-living-files/healthy-for-life/beans-rice-complete-protein-english.pdf?la=en#:~:text=The%20combination%20of%20beans%20and,to%20form%20a%20complete%20protein." target="_blank">this online PDF</a> for
	    more details.</p>
	</p>

	<p>
	    In addition, the only real requisites for making beans are
	    the beans themselves, a pot to cook them in, and water.
	</p>

	<h2>Preparation</h2>

	<h3>Soaking</h3>
	<p>
	    Soaking beans allows the dried beans to absorb water,
	    which begins to dissolve starches that would otherwise
	    cause intestinal discomfort.
	</p>

	<ol>
	    <li>Clean the beans, and rinse them.</li>
	    <li>
		In a large pot, add 10 cups of water for each pound (2
		cups) of dry beans. Heat to boiling; boil for 2â€“3
		minutes. Remove from heat, cover and soak for up to 4
		hours. This is known as <em>hot soaking</em>.
		Hot soaking is the preferred method since it
		reduces cooking time, helps dissolve some of the
		gas-causing substances in beans, and most consistently
		produces tender beans.
	    </li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Cooking the Beans: Stovetop Instructions</h3>
	<ol>
	    <li>Place beans in a large pot; cover with fresh water and bring to a boil.</li>
	    <li>
		Reduce heat, cover and simmer gently until beans are
		tender but firm. Most beans will cook in 45 minutes to 2
		hours depending on the variety.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		Periodically, try a taste test or mash a bean against
		the side of the pot with a fork or spoon. Check
		occasionally if you need to add more water.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		Here are some approximate cooking times for beans:
		<ul>
		    <li>Black beans: 60-90 minutes</li>
		    <li>Great Northern beans: 45-60 minutes</li>
		    <li>Kidney beans: 90-120 minutes</li>
		    <li>Navy beans: 90-120 minutes</li>
		    <li>Pinto beans: 90-120 minutes</li>
		</ul>
	    </li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Notes on When to Add Flavorings</h3>
	<ul>
	    <li>
		Herbs and spices may be added any time, but it is
		recommended adding them towards the end to reduce flavor
		loss.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		Add acidic foods (lemon juice, vinegar, tomatoes, wine,
		etc.) only <em>after</em> beans are cooked, as these
		foods can prevent the beans from becoming tender.
	    </li>
	</ul>
