	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>White rice is easy to make, and a perfect blank canvas to
	    add other delicacies of your choice to. Hence, I've included
	    it in this set of recipes.</p>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
	    <li>1 cup long grain white rice</li>
	    <li>2 cups water</li>
	    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
 	</ul>

	<h2>Preparation</h2>
	<ol>
	    <li>Rise the rice in cold water.</li>
	    <li>Bring the water to a boil.</li>
	    <li>Add the butter and salt, then stir.</li>
	    <li>Add the rice. Stir.</li>
	    <li>Reduce heat to low, cover, and let simmer for 20 minutes. Check after 15
		minutes if water has evaporated; if so, the rice is ready. If not, then cover
		again and let simmer for five more minutes.</li>
	    <li>Remove from heat and fluff with a fork. Garnish with
		butter and parsley, if desired.</li>
	</ol>
